# Nexus Expense 

This is an console application for tracking expenses.
Currently this app has an inbuilt three expense categories - Essential, Personal and Miscellaneous

All the user data inputs in the application is validated for Null, Whitespaces and incorrect datatypes.

This project is aimed to familiarize with the basics of C# and this console application would be improved to an full fledged application in future.

Cheers,
Kannan AN.
