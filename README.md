# Nexus Expense 

This is an console application for tracking expenses and budget health

This project is aimed to learn,familiarize and practice with the basics of C#.

Week 1 - Datatypes, Strings, Loops and Data validation
All the user input in the application is handled for null, whitespaces and incorrect datatypes validation.

Logic - Ask the user their budget and expenses. Currently the expenses are divided into three categories - Essential, Personal and Miscellaneous. Once user enters all their expenses, we end the program with an final output. 

Trying to make this project better everyday by learning new concepts in C#
Cheers,
Kannan AN.
